<h2>About BioTorrents.de</h2>

<section class="tldr">
  <p>
    BioTorrents.de is a functional experiment in comfy data distribution.
    The tagline is "What.cd for genome sequences."
    The scope is multidisciplinary and social science friendly.
  </p>

  <p>
    It indexes a wide variety of biology data and serves it on a fast BitTorrent network.
    The semantic website promotes organic content discovery and community annotations.
    Other interfaces include a JSON API, RSS feeds, and IRC channels.
  </p>

  <p>
    BioTorrents.de is an open platform for disadvantaged researchers to host their data.
    More importantly, it provides the necessary tools for others to find and cite it later.
    It's a place for the Google Drives, FTP folders, and network shares that may not be accepted elsewhere.
    It also plays well with institutional repositories and can efficiently mirror their data.
  </p>

  <p>
    A mature software product and draft publication are expected by Easter 2023.
    Thank you for your curiosity, patience, and support as we grow the service.
