## Collection rules

- Collection vandalism is taken very seriously, resulting in loss of collection editing privileges at a minimum.

- A well-defined group of people, for instance Counter Culture Labs members, may create a Group Picks collection with one pick per person.
  Please avoid making Group Picks without an affirmative staff PM reply to your request.

- There may only be one collection per Theme.
  Duplicate collections will be deleted.
  The collection allowed to stay is the best maintained and oldest collection.
  In a word, the most established one.

- Theme collections must be sensible and reasonably broad.
  Those that don't fit this description will be deleted.
  Note the conceptual space this rule allows.

- Collections are **not** an alternative to the tagging system.
  A collection such as Fungi Torrents wouldn't be allowed because we have the
  <span class="important_text_alt">fungi</span> tag.
  Naturally a Fungi rRNA Barcodes collection is different.

- Every collection must have at least 3 torrent groups in it except for Personal ones.

- Please check to see that a similar collection doesn't already exist.
  If one does, please contribute to that.

- If you must make a new collection, please give it an appropriate title and a decent description explaining its purpose,
  and attempt to add a cover image to every torrent in it.
