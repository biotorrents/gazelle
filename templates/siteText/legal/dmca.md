## DMCA policy

_If_ you're a copyright owner or an agent of one,
_and_ you reasonably believe that user-generated content on the domains torrents.bio or biotorrents.de infringes your copyrights:
_then_ you may notify our Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) agent in writing.
All of these elements are required:

- Identification of the copyrighted work you claim is infringed.
  _Please include your copyright registration number or proof of status pending._
  Claims for U.S. works require registration.

- Identification of the material you claim is infringing.
  To speed up processing, please include:
  (1) the permalink `[PL]` URI, _and_
  (2) the BitTorrent `info_hash`.

- A statement that you have a good faith belief that the material's use in the manner you complain of isn't authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

- A statement that the notification's information is accurate, and under penalty of perjury,
  that you're authorized to act on behalf of an allegedly infringed exclusive right.

- Your physical or electronic signature, or of someone authorized to act on your behalf.

- Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you,
  such as an address, telephone number, and email.

Because a high percentage of DMCA takedown notices are invalid or abusive,
Omics Tools LLC reserves the right to ignore requests for unregistered works.
We'll expeditiously disable access to the targets of valid requests.
