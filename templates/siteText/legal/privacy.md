You consent on account registration by checking the box labelled,
"I consent to the privacy policy."

### Data collection: what and how

We collect and use personal data defined as

- usernames, email addresses, passphrases, and 2FA seeds;
- GPG keys, IRC keys, API keys, passkeys, and authkeys;
- IP addresses, and login and access timestamps;
- account preferences, activity, and history;
- and server error logs.

We don't collect cross-origin data.
Also, we don't access
[browser features](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy#directives)
such as camera, microphone, and sensors.

You directly provide us with most personal data.
We collect data when you

- register online for our services,
- query the tracker for BitTorrent peers,
- participate in our forums and chat rooms,
- and use our website with cookies or API keys.

### Data use and storage

We use your personal data to manage your account and administer the site.
We don't sell or provide data to third parties, except as required by law.

We store your personal data on our own servers.
Sensitive data is encrypted or hashed, defined as:
email and IP addresses, private messages, passphrases, and API keys.

We'll keep your personal data until account termination.
Please contact us to terminate your account.
Termination deletes your personal data and revokes your passkey.

We don't store IP address, geolocation, passphrase, or passkey history.
Note that we may need to keep data for archiving purposes.
