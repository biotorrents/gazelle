## About BioTorrents.de

BioTorrents.de is a functional experiment in comfy data distribution.
The tagline is "What.cd for genome sequences."
The scope is multidisciplinary and social science friendly.

It indexes a wide variety of biology data and serves it on a fast BitTorrent network.
The semantic website promotes organic content discovery and community annotations.
Other interfaces include a JSON API, RSS feeds, and IRC channels.

BioTorrents.de is an open platform for disadvantaged researchers to host their data.
More importantly, it provides the necessary tools for others to find and cite it later.
It's a place for the Google Drives, FTP folders, and network shares that may not be accepted elsewhere.
It also plays well with institutional repositories and can efficiently mirror their data.

A mature software product and draft publication are expected by Easter 2024.
Thank you for your curiosity, patience, and support as we grow the service.
