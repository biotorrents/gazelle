## Budget breakdown

We have no advertisements, aren't sponsored, and provide our services gratis.
If you're financially able, please help pay our bills by donating.
We use the donations to cover the costs of running the site and tracker.

No individual responsible for the site's operation personally profits from donations.
As a donor, your financial support is exclusively applied to operating costs.
By donating, you're helping to defray the recurring costs of necessary information services.

We operate on a shoestring budget.
The costs of running the site, and all its technical and legal infrastructure, are minimal by design.
Please find a detailed site budget below.

- **Servers.** We use six budget VPS at 3.50€ per month each.

- **Domain.** The primary domain name (torrents.bio) is $80 per year. The secondary one (biotorrents.de) is $15 per year.

- **Company.** The parent company costs $50 per year for annual reports and $125 for resident agent services.

- **Legal.** Registering a U.S. copyright agent is $6 per year.

- **Total.** Depending on the exchange rate, it costs about $525 per year to run the site.

## What donating means for your account

Please remember that when you make a donation, you aren't "purchasing" Donor Ranks, invites, or any specific benefit.
