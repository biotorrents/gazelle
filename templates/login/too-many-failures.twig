Dear {{ username }},

We noticed some unusual login attempts on your account from the IP address [url=https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip/{{ ipaddr}}]{{ ipaddr }}[/url] and blocked further access to the site from this address for six hours.

If you know that this was yourself, you do not need to take further action. If it was not yourself and your password is short or used on another site, you should change it immediately to something stronger and not used anywhere else.

If this happens frequently, you should get in touch with Staff.
