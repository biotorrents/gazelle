Hello,

The member {{ username }} has invited you to join {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }}
and has specified this address {{ email }} as your email address. If you do
not know this person, please ignore this email and do not reply.

Please note that selling invites, trading invites, and giving invites away
publicly (e.g. on a forum) is strictly forbidden. If you have received your
invite as a result of any of these things, do not bother signing up - you
will be banned and lose your chances of ever signing up legitimately.

If you have previously held an account at {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }}, do not use this invite.
Instead, please join {{ constant('BOT_DISABLED_CHAN') }}  on {{ constant('BOT_SERVER') }}  and ask for your account
to be reactivated.

To confirm your invitation, click on the following link or paste it into a
browser:

{{ constant('SITE_URL') }}/register.php?invite={{ key }}

During registration, you may use another email address if you prefer.
Ideally it should not be an address used anywhere else. After you
register, you will receive a confirmation email and once you have replied
to that you will be able to use your account. Please take note that if you
do not use this invite in the next 3 days, it will expire. We urge you to
read the RULES and the wiki immediately after you join.

Thank you,
{{ constant('SITE_NAME') }} Staff
