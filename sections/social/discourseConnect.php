 * Discourse will redirect clients to discourse_connect_url with a signed payload: (say discourse_connect_url is https://somesite.com/sso)
 * You will receive incoming traffic with the following
 * https://somesite.com/sso?sso=PAYLOAD&sig=SIG
 * The payload is a Base64 encoded string comprising of a nonce 1.2k, and a return_sso_url. The payload is always a valid querystring.
 * For example, if the nonce is ABCD. raw_payload will be:
 * nonce=ABCD&return_sso_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscourse_site%2Fsession%2Fsso_login, this raw payload is base 64 219 encoded.
