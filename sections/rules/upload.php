          <?= $ENV->SITE_NAME ?> is an annotated repository of
          biology data
          and a bioinformatics learning community.
          Gazelle in its current state requires lots of hardcoded metadata.

          <strong>Seed Forever.</strong>
          Private torrent trackers succeed when they offer quality niche content and a comfy interface.
          This isn't an NCBI data dump but a library of annotated info hashes that tomorrow's networks can ingest.
          Do not upload a torrent unless you intend to seed until there are at least 3 copies.
          Three is a good minimum swarm size.

        <li id="r1.3"><a href="#h1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.3">1.3</a>
          <strong>No Advertising.</strong>
          Please don't "tag" torrents, include ASCII art, or make your torrents look like they came from the Pirate Bay.
          These kinds of additions are allowed if they serve a relevant purpose.
          Enclosing a GPG-signed hash of your data isn't a bad idea at all.

          Everything but private messages, and especially torrents and the forums, should be in English.

          <strong>Folder Structure.</strong>
          Each torrent should be a single folder so we can manage them easier.
          Please avoid unnecessary nested folders inside your torrent.
          Use one of the examples below for your main folder.

          <ul>
            <li>One-Shot Project Name</li>
            <li>Torrent Title - Accession Number</li>
            <li>Department/Lab - Project Name</li>
            <li>After the Name - Extra comments as necessary</li>
          </ul>

          I also strongly recommend you compress only large files or long image series, and not simply compress the
          entire dataset.
          This makes it easier to partially seed large datasets, work with discrete parts of the data, and know what's
          on disk.
        </li>

        <li id="r1.8"><a href="#h1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.8">1.8</a>
          <strong>File Organization.</strong>
          Please either keep the original filenames from the processing service, or consistently use a legible naming
          scheme.
          Remove all .DS_Store, Thumbs.db, nfo files, and other junk files before making the torrent.
          It should be "clean."
          You're encouraged to keep Git repos, structured data reports, readmes, and other useful annotations.
          Files should sort appropriately: use leading zeroes.
        </li>

        <li id="r1.9"><a href="#h1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.9">1.9</a>
          <strong>Compression.</strong>
          "10 GB or 10,000 files."
          Compression is required if your torrent is > 10 GiB or if it contains > 10,000 files.
          Otherwise, please compress text files only if it reduces the torrent size by > 30% and avoid compressing
          binary files.
          Multipart archives are only allowed for torrents > 10 GiB.

        <li id="r1.10"><a href="#h1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.10">1.10</a>
          <strong>Metadata.</strong>
          Avoid matching folder names to <?= $ENV->SITE_NAME ?>
          metadata.
          The site design will change but the torrents are evergreen.
          When What.cd went down, it was possible to seed most of your old torrents at Redacted.ch because the info
          hashes matched.
          The <code>.torrent</code> points to cryptographically verified folders and files that are tracked for
          convenience.
          On the flipside, please add enough metadata so that people can pick it out of a list.
        </li>

        <li id="r1.11"><a href="#h1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.11">1.11</a>
          <strong>Supplemental Packs.</strong>
          I strongly recommend <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning</a> for your original
          data.
          Supplemental packs may include a collection of citations, documents, utilities, protocols, metadata, disk
          images, etc., specifically prepared for release.
          The collection should be a separate torrent if the collection constitutes a project in its own right.
          If you only have metadata generated in the data processing workflow, please include it in the main torrent.

          <strong>Multiple Formats Allowed.</strong>
          It's fine if there's an EMBL and a FASTA of the same data. If you need to convert a dataset for your own
          analysis,
          please upload a quality conversion with supplemetal info.
          Remember that small, one-shot metadata are better included with the data, and collections of docs and utils
          are better separate from it.
          If only the header is different and it follows the "10 GB or 10,000 files" rule, uncompressed torrents trump
          compressed ones.
          It should be easy for others with the same data to change a line and check out the new torrent.

          <strong>SemVer Trumps.</strong>
          Versioned data can be trumped at the patch level.
          Major and minor releases can coexist.
          Please add a link in the old data's Torrent Group Description to the new data.
          Git repos can be trumped at the commit and patch levels.
          Then normal SemVer rules take effect for properly tagged releases.
          In an ideal world, only releases tagged with a specific version number would be allowed because this is
          BitTorrent's main strength.

        <li id="r2.3"><a href="#h2"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r2.3">2.3</a>
          <strong>Report Trumps and Dupes.</strong>
          If you trump a torrent or notice a duplicate torrent, please use the report link [RP] to notify staff to
          remove it.
          If you are uploading a superior version, e.g., without watermarks, report the older torrent and include a link
          to your new torrent.
          Your torrent may be deleted as a dupe if the older torrent is not reported.

        <li id="r2.4"><a href="#h2"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r2.4">2.4</a>
          <strong>One Month Unseeded.</strong>
          Please try requesting a reseed before anything.
          This sends a mass PM to all snatchers asking them to resume seeding the files.
          If you have the original torrent files for the inactive torrent, reseed those instead of uploading a new
          torrent.
          Uploading a replacement torrent should be done only when the original files are unavailable and/or the torrent
          hasn't been seeded for a month.
          The site automatically deletes dead torrents after 6 months.

          <strong>Stupid Compression.</strong>
          If someone uploads, e.g., a gzip of 1000 images, you can trump the torrent with an uncompressed version.
          Likewise, a compressed torrent with folders of 10,000 reads each is trumpable by one where the file structure
          is visible, even if the data itself is compressed.

          The number can be any format but it must correspond to the actual nucleotide or amino acid sequences

          <strong>Scope.</strong>
          The resolution of the data.
          How much information about the organism does it represent?
          The options correspond in higher conceptual language to:
          a single piece of information, structural information, especially deep or broad information, and an exhaustive
          source.
          Please use the Other option if you'd like to enter a specific resolution such as "420 subjects from Boston."

          <strong>Picture.</strong>
          Please upload a meaningful picture, especially if you plan to add the torrent to a collection.
          A photo of the sequence sample or a representative photo of the organism; an example (preferably not a
          thumbnail collection) from an imaging dataset;
          a screenshot of a useful table from the publication; or another similarly informative picture.
          No picture is better than an irrelevant one.

          <strong>Mirrors.</strong>
          <?= $ENV->SITE_NAME ?> supports up to two FTP/HTTP web
          seeds on
          an experimental basis according to
          <a href="https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019.html" target="_blank">BEP 19 (GetRight style)</a>.
          Please note that not all clients support web seeds, and of those that do, having too many may cause problems
          for you.
          The web seeds must be unencrypted.
          The site automatically rewrites <code>ftps://</code> and <code>https://</code> web addresses.
          Additionally, the contents of the FTP/HTTP folder must correspond exactly to the contents of the
          <code>.torrent</code> file.
          Given these caveats, it's worth documenting the data source for accuracy's sake and to let people save ratio
          here.

          <strong>Publications.</strong>
          DOI numbers should be well-formed, one per line.
          The site currently discards malformed DOI numbers instead of extracting them from arbitrary strings.
          An auto-extract and metadata fetching are in development.
          If your research is a normal URI, please use the Torrent Group Description field.

          This is the main body text on a torrent's page.

          This text is hidden by default.
          It displays when you click the Torrent Title next to [ DL | RP ].

          <strong>Aligned/Annotated.</strong>
          Does the data come with any metadata of an analytical nature, such as alignment data (mandatory if checked)?
          If so, does the torrent folder contain the scripts used to generate the metadata (optional)?

          You'll still get upload credit even if you hide your username from the torrent details.
          I believe it's still visible to sysops.
